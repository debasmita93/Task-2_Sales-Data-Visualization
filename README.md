# Task-2_Sales-Data-Visualization
This is a dataset taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final), which talks about the sales data in a superstore. I had performed data visualization by creating an interactive dashboard the reporting all the key performance indicators (KPIs) like Total Sales, Total Profits and Profit Percentage of each Product ID in different regions of United States using Power BI.
